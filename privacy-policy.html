            <p><strong>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</strong></p>
            <p><strong>USERS</strong></p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the terms and conditions under which we will collect and process your
                personal data when we provide the Service.</p>
            <p>If you are a user, whenever you open a layer when using our Service, you will be connected automatically
                with the server of the Third Party Content provider. Our system transmits an anonymous hash, which
                cannot be traced back to the device used to activate the Service. Alternatively, you may access the
                Service through a user account you have set up with a publisher or another third party. We will not
                store any personal data that relate to your user account with that third party, and we advise you to
                read the privacy policy applied by such third party, as these terms will also apply to you. Please note
                that these third parties may apply their own policies with respect to cookies.</p>
            <p>We allow you to login through social networks that you have linked to, provided that you have fully
                complied with their requirements on creating a user account, and that you refer to such networks as part
                of your profile.</p>
            <p>All Third Party Content which you can access through the Service is provided to you by those third
                parties. In most cases, we do not process Third Party Content; however, for some features it is
                inevitable that some personal data will be collected through our App and Service or through other
                contacts. By accessing Third Party Content, you grant us permission to collect, use, process and store
                any of your personal data that may be contained therein.</p>
            <p>Third parties, such as Publishers, are the controllers with regard to the processing of your personal
                data in connection with your use of the Third Party Content, and, in that capacity, are solely
                responsible for compliance with applicable data protection and other legislation and regulations with
                regard to such processing.</p>
            <p>Our servers will aggregate, store and process data in respect of Reference Images. You grant us
                permission to collect, use, process and store any of your personal data that are contained therein.</p>
            <p>By exchanging, providing and/or uploading User Generated Content, you grant us permission to use, store
                and process any of your personal data that are contained therein. You should be fully aware that any
                personal data of third parties that are contained in your User Generated Content are subject to data
                protection and other legislation and regulations and you are fully responsible for compliance with these
                laws and regulations. We require that you exercise due care when exchanging personal data of others as
                part of your User Generated Content.</p>
            <p>Whenever you return to the Publisher or third party’s server, it will recognize you as a repeat visitor,
                but –unless you provided your personal data, such as username or IP address –, the system will not be
                able to trace you.</p>
            <p>Only you determine the purposes for which you collect, use and disclose content, including your User
                Generated Content, through the App or the Reality Browser; you are the controller with regard to these
                data.</p>
            <p><strong>LOG DATA AND LOCATION DATA</strong></p>
            <p>Our servers automatically record:</p>
            <p>information created by your use of and contribution to the Service (“Log Data”); and</p>
            <p>images the Developer supplies to BLINK in order to enable the extraction by users of features for
                recognition through the Service.</p>
            <p>Log Data may include information such as your phone ID, browser type, click paths and search terms.
                Interactions between users and publishers may also be included in Log Data. We will aggregate and
                anonymize the Log Data, add up all individual events and only use the aggregate data for statistical
                purposes. We remove the Log Data every two months.</p>
            <p>We will collect, use and store location data for which you gave us your consent, including but not
                limited to your GPS-location, which were provided by you or which we receive from GPS location service
                providers but only for as long as this is necessary for delivering our Service and/or to the extent
                required or permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p><strong>2. COLLECTION, USE AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
            <p>We commit to not selling or providing your personal data to third parties. We may use the collected
                personal data for the following purposes:</p>
            <p>(i) the provision of access to the Service, including the Reality Browser, and subsequent transmission of
                Third Party or User Generated Content, including the extraction by us of features from Reference Images
                to provide the Service;</p>
            <p>(ii) enabling you to share your information and communicate with other users;</p>
            <p>(iii) sending you electronic messages containing service or
                –promotional communications about BLINK;</p>
            <p>(iv) improvement and technical administration of the App and/or Service; and</p>
            <p>(v) the distribution of the Third Party Content and/or User Generated Content.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with
                applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect us or our
                (other) users. We may also disclose your personal data to third parties in the event that we sell or buy
                any business or assets. We reserve the right to disclose anonymized user data to the prospective seller
                or buyer of such business or assets. If BLINK or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a
                third party, personal data about you as a customer will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
            <p><strong>3. DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures pertaining to the storage
                and provision of personal data, in order to, amongst other things, prevent access to your personal data
                by any unauthorised persons.</p>
            <p>Your personal data shall only be accessed by authorised staff.</p>
            <p>These staff members are obliged to preserve the confidentiality of all the information that comes to
                their attention, unless disclosure is compulsory by law or necessary for the fulfilment of their
                task.</p>
            <p><strong>4. YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
            <p>You can request to access your personal data and you can verify/correct their accuracy. You can also
                request the removal of your personal data. Upon verification of your identity, we will rectify, erase or
                block your personal data, if these data are incorrect or if you no longer want us to process these data.
                Due to the requested removal, it is however possible that we cannot ensure the provision to you of (part
                of) our Service.</p>
